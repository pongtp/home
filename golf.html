					<td>In golf, everyone can get some fresh air and gaze at the beautiful sight of nature. It's the perfect sport

					</td>
					<td>Studies have found that golf can actually increase your life expectancy up to five years. 
						This shouldn't be too shocking since we already know it helps improve the body mentally and physically.</td>
					<td>In golf, we don't just learn new skills designated solely for the sport, we also learn things like how to develop patience.</td>
					<td>This can be both obvious or confusing at the same time. Let me explain. In golf, it's true that
						we play by ourselves(it's a single-person sport), but we can also play with others in a way. I mean, 
						there are no teams or tactics that are involved, but you can still play beside your friends and talk 
						golf and maybe even compare who has got the farthest shot.</td>

		<h2>Information about me</h2>
		<p>
			I first started playing golf at the age of 11.
			This was when I took private lesssons in the golf dome where
			I was still learning how to swing the golf club.
			I am not proud to say that I pretty much missed all my shots, but it's to be expected.
			I occasionally joined some golf camps in the <a href="https://www.golfsalemridge.com/">Salem Ridge golf academy</a>.
			At this time, I wasn't the strongest (mainly the weakest) 
			person in the group, so I had a hard time carrying the bags around the golf course.
			The average golf bag weighs around 20 to 50 pounds which I find is a lot to carry if someone
			has to walk for hours at a time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nevertheless, the golf camp was fun. We got to take a peek at nature (we saw a snapping turtle once) 
			and we watched the movie "Jumanji" while enjoying some freezies. Those were just some fun things I can remember
			, but we really did far more than just that. We walked around the golf course and took some shots
			in the high areas (where the golf balls usually fell in the lake or forest). Overall, it was quite an unforgettable experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are a lot of <a href="https://www.liveabout.com/meet-the-golf-clubs-1560507">clubs</a>(the swinging kind) in golf, it might seem very daunting 
			as to which one you should choose as they are all meant for different situations. For me, I mostly play 
			at the driving range where we can use almost all our golf clubs. The driving range is just what is sounds like.
			It's where we just take some shots and see how far or high the ball goes, it depends on how the person wants to play.
			I mainly use my seven-iron. It's essentially the club that is meant for almost all situations. It can go
			relatively far (with the right skill) and it can go decently high (again, with the right skill). However,
			sometimes I feel like I just want to have some "extra" fun, this is where the driver comes in.
			Previously I mentioned how the driving range is meant so see how far the ball goes. Well, the driver
			is the perfect club for the driving range. There's not too much aiming involved and with the right technique,
			one can hit it really far, even without the using too much strength.
		</p>
		<p>
			If anyone wants to start playing golf and start taking some lessons, 
			I would recommend the <a href="https://www.golfsalemridge.com/">Salem Ridge golf academy</a> 
			as they have excellent instructors. Although, starting and learning golf may be quite expensive, so
			only those who are serious about playing golf should actually consider this. Anyway, in conclusion, golf
			is one of my favourite pass-time hobbies and I really hope it will become one of yours as well.
