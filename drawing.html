		<h1 id="Top">Drawing is one of my hobbies.</h1>
		<h2>By Tobias Pong</h2>

		<p>
			Now usually, I just draw something like a cool character in approximately 5 min,<br>
			but sometimes I actually put more effort in and take up 2 hours to draw something that I might find challenging.
			<br>Here are some of those drawings.

				<th>Dog</th>
				<th>Musician</th>

			Something that I need to fix is that I am a perfectionist when it comes to art.
			Now what I mean by that, is that whenever I don't like what I draw, 
			I am very tempted to just throw that drawing away, and yes, I draw on paper.
			Don't get me wrong, I don't do that every time I don't like a drawing in progress.
			I just feel very tempted to just waste the paper and throw away my drawing like it was a huge waste of my time.
			I am trying desperately to avoid this ongoing habit. 
			Fortunately, I rarely draw due to my busy schedule, so I seldom have to worry about wasting a lot of paper.
		</p>

		<p> 
			Earlier, I mentioned that I sometimes take five minutes to draw something quick. 
			Well, maybe that was a little bit of an exageration, just a little bit. I usually take twenty to thirty 
			minutes to draw something that I become satisfied with. I usually just draw creatures that look like they
			came out of a fictional story and sometimes I like to go out of my comfort zone and draw something
			that I haven't grown accustomed to, such as an animal. When I was younger I used to love drawing characters
			from the medieval era such as knights. I would also draw dragons with relatively simple design.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			An interesting thing about me is that I have a completely different style of drawing. 
			This is especially for the illustrations that I create in a short amount of time. Usually, the normal artist would 
			first create a skeleton and a frame for their drawing and then slowly add minor details, but for me it's different. 
			For me, I draw the head of my character first, then I move downward from the upperbody to the feet and add details along the way.
			I would do this without any frame or skeleton.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			In conclusion, drawing is one of my hobbies and hopefully this webpage has enlightened some mysteries about who I am.
			Now I'm sure there are people who are way better than me at drawing 
			and can create art that makes mine look like a bunch of scribbles and that's completely fine.
			This webpage isn't meant for me to brag or show off my "skills" (which I barely have), it's just for people to get to know me better.
